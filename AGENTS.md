# Development Rules

## First Message

If the user did not give you a concrete task in their first message,
read README.md, then ask which module(s) to work on. Based on the answer, read the relevant README.md files in parallel.

- packages/ai/README.md
- packages/tui/README.md
- packages/agent/README.md
- packages/coding-agent/README.md
- packages/mom/README.md
- packages/pods/README.md
- packages/web-ui/README.md

## Code Quality

- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Check node_modules for external API type definitions instead of guessing
- **NEVER use inline imports** - no `await import("./foo.js")`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions, no dynamic imports for types. Always use standard top-level imports.
- NEVER remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated dependencies; upgrade the dependency instead
- Always ask before removing functionality or code that appears to be intentional
- Never hardcode key checks with, eg. `matchesKey(keyData, "ctrl+x")`. All keybindings must be configurable. Add default to matching object (`DEFAULT_EDITOR_KEYBINDINGS` or `DEFAULT_APP_KEYBINDINGS`)

## Commands

This project uses **bun** as the package manager and **turborepo** for builds.

### Running Commands

- **Build**: `bun run build` - Uses turborepo for parallel, cached builds
- **Check**: `bun run check` - Lint, format, and type check
- **Test**: `bun run test` - Run all package tests
- **Dev**: `bun run dev` - Start dev servers for all packages

### Important Rules

- After code changes (not documentation changes): `bun run check` (get full output, no tail). Fix all errors, warnings, and infos before committing.
- Note: `bun run check` does not run tests.
- NEVER run: `bun run dev`, `bun run build`, `bun test`
- Only run specific tests if user instructs: `npx tsx ../../node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js --run test/specific.test.ts`
- Run tests from the package root, not the repo root.
- If you create or modify a test file, you MUST run that test file and iterate until it passes.
- When writing tests, run them, identify issues in either the test or implementation, and iterate until fixed.
- NEVER commit unless user asks

### Turborepo

The monorepo uses turborepo for build orchestration:

- Builds run in parallel based on dependency graph (e.g., `tui` and `ai` build first, then dependent packages)
- Local caching makes repeated builds fast (~30ms vs ~18s for full build)
- CI also uses turbo caching for faster builds

### Local Development with mise

For testing the pi binary locally, use mise:

```bash
mise run link-bin    # Build binary and create bin/ symlink
./bin/pi --version   # Run the binary
```

## GitHub Issues

When reading issues:

- Always read all comments on the issue
- Use this command to get everything in one call:

  ```bash
  gh issue view <number> --json title,body,comments,labels,state
  ```

## Tools

- GitHub CLI for issues/PRs
- Add package labels to issues/PRs: pkg:agent, pkg:ai, pkg:coding-agent, pkg:mom, pkg:pods, pkg:tui, pkg:web-ui

## Testing pi Interactive Mode with tmux

To test pi's TUI in a controlled terminal environment:

```bash
# Create tmux session with specific dimensions
tmux new-session -d -s pi-test -x 80 -y 24

# Start pi from source
tmux send-keys -t pi-test "cd /Users/badlogic/workspaces/pi-mono && ./pi-test.sh" Enter

# Wait for startup, then capture output
sleep 3 && tmux capture-pane -t pi-test -p

# Send input
tmux send-keys -t pi-test "your prompt here" Enter

# Send special keys
tmux send-keys -t pi-test Escape
tmux send-keys -t pi-test C-o  # ctrl+o

# Cleanup
tmux kill-session -t pi-test
```

## Style

- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text
- Technical prose only, be kind but direct (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")

## Changelog

Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (each package has its own)

### Format

Use these sections under `## [Unreleased]`:

- `### Breaking Changes` - API changes requiring migration
- `### Added` - New features
- `### Changed` - Changes to existing functionality
- `### Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `### Removed` - Removed features

### Rules

- Before adding entries, read the full `[Unreleased]` section to see which subsections already exist
- New entries ALWAYS go under `## [Unreleased]` section
- Append to existing subsections (e.g., `### Fixed`), do not create duplicates
- NEVER modify already-released version sections (e.g., `## [0.12.2]`)
- Each version section is immutable once released

### Attribution

- **Internal changes (from issues)**: `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/123))`
- **External contributions**: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`

## Adding a New LLM Provider (packages/ai)

Adding a new provider requires changes across multiple files:

### 1. Core Types (`packages/ai/src/types.ts`)

- Add API identifier to `Api` type union (e.g., `"bedrock-converse-stream"`)
- Create options interface extending `StreamOptions`
- Add mapping to `ApiOptionsMap`
- Add provider name to `KnownProvider` type union

### 2. Provider Implementation (`packages/ai/src/providers/`)

Create provider file exporting:

- `stream<Provider>()` function returning `AssistantMessageEventStream`
- `streamSimple<Provider>()` for `SimpleStreamOptions` mapping
- Provider-specific options interface
- Message/tool conversion functions
- Response parsing emitting standardized events (`text`, `tool_call`, `thinking`, `usage`, `stop`)

### 3. Stream Integration (`packages/ai/src/stream.ts`)

- Import provider's stream function and options type
- Add credential detection in `getEnvApiKey()`
- Add case in `mapOptionsForApi()` for `SimpleStreamOptions` mapping
- Add provider to `streamFunctions` map

### 4. Model Generation (`packages/ai/scripts/generate-models.ts`)

- Add logic to fetch/parse models from provider source
- Map to standardized `Model` interface

### 5. Tests (`packages/ai/test/`)

Add provider to: `stream.test.ts`, `tokens.test.ts`, `abort.test.ts`, `empty.test.ts`, `context-overflow.test.ts`, `image-limits.test.ts`, `unicode-surrogate.test.ts`, `tool-call-without-result.test.ts`, `image-tool-result.test.ts`, `total-tokens.test.ts`, `cross-provider-handoff.test.ts`.

For `cross-provider-handoff.test.ts`, add at least one provider/model pair. If the provider exposes multiple model families (for example GPT and Claude), add at least one pair per family.

For non-standard auth, create utility (e.g., `bedrock-utils.ts`) with credential detection.

### 6. Coding Agent (`packages/coding-agent/`)

- `src/core/model-resolver.ts`: Add default model ID to `DEFAULT_MODELS`
- `src/cli/args.ts`: Add env var documentation
- `README.md`: Add provider setup instructions

### 7. Documentation

- `packages/ai/README.md`: Add to providers table, document options/auth, add env vars
- `packages/ai/CHANGELOG.md`: Add entry under `## [Unreleased]`

## Releasing

**Lockstep versioning**: All packages always share the same version number. Every release updates all packages together.

**Automated releases**: Releasing is fully automated via GitHub Actions. No manual steps required after pushing the tag.

### Version Semantics (no major releases)

- `patch`: Bug fixes and new features
- `minor`: API breaking changes

### Release Process

1. **Document changes**: Ensure all changes are in `[Unreleased]` sections of relevant CHANGELOG.md files

2. **Create release**:

   ```bash
   bun run release:patch    # Bug fixes and new features
   bun run release:minor    # API breaking changes
   ```

   This handles:
   - Bumping version in all package.json files
   - Syncing versions across packages
   - Committing changes
   - Creating the version tag (e.g., `v0.63.0`)

3. **Push tags**:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   git push --tags
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions handles the rest**:
   - Updates CHANGELOGs ([Unreleased] → [version] - date)
   - Publishes all packages to npm
   - Builds binaries for all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
   - Creates GitHub release with binaries and changelog

### Manual Release (if needed)

If GitHub Actions is unavailable, trigger `release.yml` manually from the Actions tab, or:

```bash
git tag v0.x.x
git push origin v0.x.x
```

## **CRITICAL** Tool Usage Rules **CRITICAL**

- NEVER use sed/cat to read a file or a range of a file. Always use the read tool (use offset + limit for ranged reads).
- You MUST read every file you modify in full before editing.

## **CRITICAL** Git Rules for Parallel Agents **CRITICAL**

Multiple agents may work on different files in the same worktree simultaneously. You MUST follow these rules:

### Committing

- **ONLY commit files YOU changed in THIS session**
- ALWAYS include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the commit message when there is a related issue or PR
- NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .` - these sweep up changes from other agents
- ALWAYS use `git add <specific-file-paths>` listing only files you modified
- Before committing, run `git status` and verify you are only staging YOUR files
- Track which files you created/modified/deleted during the session

### Forbidden Git Operations

These commands can destroy other agents' work:

- `git reset --hard` - destroys uncommitted changes
- `git checkout .` - destroys uncommitted changes
- `git clean -fd` - deletes untracked files
- `git stash` - stashes ALL changes including other agents' work
- `git add -A` / `git add .` - stages other agents' uncommitted work
- `git commit --no-verify` - bypasses required checks and is never allowed

### Safe Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check status first
git status

# 2. Add ONLY your specific files
git add packages/ai/src/providers/transform-messages.ts
git add packages/ai/CHANGELOG.md

# 3. Commit
git commit -m "fix(ai): description"

# 4. Push (pull --rebase if needed, but NEVER reset/checkout)
git pull --rebase && git push
```

### If Rebase Conflicts Occur

- Resolve conflicts in YOUR files only
- If conflict is in a file you didn't modify, abort and ask the user
- NEVER force push
